# Product Requirements Document: AI Tutor Goal Achievement Platform

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Tutor Goal Achievement Platform is a comprehensive web application that helps users break down large learning objectives into manageable, structured journeys with AI-powered tutoring support. The platform addresses the problem of overwhelming, unstructured learning paths by providing personalized guidance, milestone tracking, and interactive AI tutoring to ensure users achieve their educational goals effectively.

**Primary Goal:** Enable users to transform abstract learning goals into actionable, time-bound learning journeys with continuous AI support and progress tracking.

## Goals

1. **Goal Decomposition:** Automatically break down user-defined learning goals into structured 6-week to 6-month journeys with weekly/bi-weekly milestones
2. **AI-Powered Learning:** Provide context-aware AI tutoring that adapts to user's current learning module and specific use cases
3. **Progress Accountability:** Implement flexible check-in systems and comprehensive progress tracking to maintain user engagement
4. **Personalized Experience:** Deliver customized learning paths and AI responses based on individual user goals and progress
5. **Seamless User Experience:** Create an intuitive, responsive platform that works across devices with smooth interactions

## User Stories
