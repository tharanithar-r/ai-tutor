### Backend Infrastructure
- `lib/db.ts` - Database connection and query utilities (shared)
- `lib/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities and middleware (shared)
- `lib/gemini.ts` - Gemini API integration utilities (shared)
- `lib/validation.ts` - Input validation schemas and functions (shared)

### Database
- `db.sql` - Database schema and initial data (already exists, needs enhancement)

### Configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template (already exists)
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration (already exists)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts (already exists, needs updates)
- `server/package.json` - Express server dependencies (Socket.io, Express, etc.)
- `server/.env` - Server-specific environment variables

### Notes

- **Hybrid Architecture:** Next.js handles frontend + API routes, Express server handles real-time chat
- **Shared Libraries:** `lib/` folder utilities work with both Next.js and Express
- **Database:** Single PostgreSQL instance shared between both servers
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens validated by both Next.js API routes and Express middleware
- **Deployment:** Next.js on Vercel, Express server on Railway/Render
- **Development:** Run both servers concurrently during development
